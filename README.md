# game-of-life
A modern C++ implementation of Conway’s Game of Life with a toroidal (wrap-around) board. The simulation is rendered in two synchronized views: a pixel-perfect 2D grid and a 3D torus that visualizes the same state as a continuous surface. Designed for clarity, performance, and a clean architecture suitable for learning and extension.
